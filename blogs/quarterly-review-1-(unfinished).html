                    <h3>Exploration</h3>
                    <p>
                        This year, I’ve been having more conversations confronting my intrinsic beliefs. Most of the time, I place aspects of my identity into convenient little boxes: ethnicity, sexuality, religion, political viewpoint, etc. Last month, I dormspammed a poll asking second-generation immigrants “How American do you feel?”, receiving over 100 responses ranging from “not at all” to “100%”. But as a second-generation Chinese immigrant who grew up in Massachusetts, how much control did I really have over the way I was raised to view the world? If the answer is “not much”, how fair is it for me to choose to associate with people that share my beliefs? Obviously there are lines, but where do I draw them? Can I make exceptions for some people and not others? I think my stance has shifted this year.
