                    <h3>Exploration</h3>
                    <p>
                        This year, I’ve been having more conversations confronting my intrinsic beliefs. Most of the time, I place aspects of my identity into convenient little boxes: ethnicity, sexuality, religion, political viewpoint, etc. Last month, I dormspammed a poll asking second-generation immigrants “How American do you feel?”, receiving over 100 responses ranging from “not at all” to “100%”.

                        But as a second-generation Chinese immigrant who grew up in Massachusetts, how much control did I really have over the way I was raised to view the world? If the answer is “not much”, how fair is it for me to choose to associate with people that share my beliefs? Obviously there are lines, but where do I draw them? Can I make exceptions for some people and not others? I think my stance has shifted this year.

                        Moral crises aside, I have really enjoyed exploring the world this year. I’ve gotten to travel to five different cities! (New Delhi, Agra, Chicago, New York, Washington D.C.) My trusty pastel turquoise suitcase and white backpack are so well-traveled now. I’ve made a lot of new friends – my kid self would be proud that I’m no longer scared of talking to people.

                        Oh, and I finally got around to getting that Harvard library card. Something about those tall bookshelves and huge windows reminds me to stay centered, to refocus and remind myself of what I’m working towards.

                    <h3>Education</h3>

                    <p>
                        This semester, I’m taking Computer Vision (6.S058), Computation Structures (6.1910), Origami/Folding Algorithms (6.5310), Statistics (18.650), Real Analysis (18.100B), and Stochastic Processes (18.615). I was registered for UPOP (2.EPE) but ultimately decided to drop it.

                    <p>
                        I’m overall enjoying all of my classes! Despite appearing to be just a barrage of math and CS classes, there’s actually a pretty wide variety of content. For example, 6.1910 and 6.S058 feel at opposite ends of CS – from logic gates and RISC-V assembly to computer graphics and training CNNs. I’m finding 18.100B the hardest to get used to, actually — the rigor of proofs needed for the class is not something I’ve previously encountered.
